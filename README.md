# Prework Ruby Assessment

**Fork this repository, clone that fork, and open up the directory in terminal.**

In the `spec/` directory you'll find spec files. Go through them sequentially (starting with `000_array_spec.rb`) and code your solutions for the tests wherever you see a comment "write your code here!" or a '__' (note you will have to remove the ''). You will either be writing your solution within the test block or within the `expect()` part of the test. You can run each spec file individually as you work on each section:

`rspec spec/000_arrays_spec.rb`

When you're finished (all of the tests pass and you're seeing green in your terminal):
* Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
* Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
* Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from)
